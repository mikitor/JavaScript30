    let string = 'string';
    let copyOfString = string;
    
    copyOfString += 'coo';
    console.log(string, copyOfString);

    // Let's say we have an array

    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    const referenceCopy = players;

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    referenceCopy.push('Miki');
    console.log(referenceCopy, players);

    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead:
    
    // 1. one way

    const copy = players.slice();

    copy.push('Not Copied');
    console.log(copy, players);

    // 2. or create a new array and concat the old one in

    const anotherCopy = [].concat(players);

    anotherCopy.push('YAY');
    console.log(anotherCopy, players);

    // 3. or use the new ES6 Spread

    const yetAnotherCopy = [...players];

    yetAnotherCopy.push('spread');
    console.log(yetAnotherCopy, players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    const copyOfPerson = person;

    copyOfPerson.name = 'Nick'
    console.log(copyOfPerson, person);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    const anotherCopyOfPerson = {...person};
    
    anotherCopyOfPerson.name = 'Kiki'
    console.log(anotherCopyOfPerson, person);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    // Difference come from that primitives are passed by value, objects are passed by reference
